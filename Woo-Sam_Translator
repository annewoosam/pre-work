# yourlastname_translator.py.

# Make a dictionary with 10 or so items (key/value pairs) whose keys are in English, and whose values are in another language you know (or make up). Each key/value pair will be an English word and its translation in your chosen language. You can call this dictionary whatever you want, but an example would be english_to_mermish.

# Below your dictionary, write a function called translate that takes an English word. Inside this function, use a conditional statement (remember those?) to (a) return the translation if the word is in your dictionary, or (b) return a message like 'Oh no! That word doesn't exist in Mermish!' if the word is not in your dictionary.

# Call the function you just created, passing in an English word from your dictionary, and save the output to a new variable. Print that variable.

# Make another function call, this time with an English word not in your dictionary. As above, save the output to a variable, and print the variable.

# our file will be renamed woo-sam_translator.py
# it will translate English to gibberish
# There are 10 words in the top_ten_gibberish_words dictionary
# save to new variable 
# print variable
# if a word isnt found reply " I am sorry. My dictionary is not yet able to translate this word from English to Gibberish."
